        "description": "¡Hi!, I am Yolit , a girl Venezuelan and lover of books, I’ve been passionate about reading for years, the books have been my warm refuge, that place where I can enjoy a thousand emotions. I always read romantic novels, in all their subgenres, erotic, suspense, etc. I am also very fond of Thriller and Noir Novel. Little by little I have been testing with other genres, such as Young Adult, New Adult and Fantasy.\n\nFor a long time I have liked to share my reviews of the books I have read, but I have always written them in Spanish, now as I am studying English, I encouraged not only to share my reviews in this language but to read those books I have always wanted and review them.\n\nI hope everyone feels comfortable in my new little blog and please forgive me if I have any mistakes in my grammar, I am still learning and looking forward to improving.",
